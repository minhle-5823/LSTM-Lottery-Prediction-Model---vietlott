# Vietlott Mega 6/45 Prediction: LSTM with Attention Mechanism

**Author:** Le Ngoc Minh

**Project Focus:** Time Series Forecasting, Deep Learning, Financial Prediction

The model is trained on historical draw data to capture sequential dependencies, aiming to predict 1-2 correct numbers on average per subsequent draw.

## ✨ Key Features & Performance
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network enhanced with an **Attention Mechanism** to better capture long-range dependencies in the historical draw data.
- **Performance:** The model correctly predicts **1-2 out of 6 winning numbers on average** in subsequent draws.
- **Number-wise Accuracy:** Achieves an estimated accuracy of **>30%** based on individual number prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Approach:** Time Series Forecasting, Deep Learning, Attention Mechanism
